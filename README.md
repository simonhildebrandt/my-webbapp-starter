# My Webapp Starter

This repo is the template I use for starting new (frequently experimental) projects.

## Rationale

This is essentially the config I've been copying from project to project for the last few years - it's minimal, (relatively) easy to reason about, and it works. Alternatives I've tried (Webpack, etc) have consistently failed some or all of the above criteria, which is why I've whittled my default loadout to this basic set of tools.

## Great extras
